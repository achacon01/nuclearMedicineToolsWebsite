Overview

Nuclear Medicine Tools is an open-source, modular website designed to perform a range of nuclear medicine calculations. Built exclusively with HTML, JavaScript, and CSS, it supports various operating systems (Ubuntu, macOS, iPadOS, Windows) and browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari). The tool consolidates key functions into one platform while ensuring high compatibility and ease of use across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

    Important: This website is provided as a tool only—it is not a certified medical device. All outputs must be verified by qualified professionals.

Features

    Modular Design: Each tool functions independently, allowing you to add, remove, or update modules with ease.
    Responsive Layout: Automatically adjusts to various screen sizes for optimal viewing on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
    Light/Dark Mode: Adapts to the user’s browser settings to reduce eye strain.
    Local Processing: All data is processed on the user’s device (except when using database functions), ensuring enhanced data security.
    Optional Database Integration: Provides functionality for saving and retrieving user data (currently implemented for waste management and GFR modules).

Project Aims

The goal of this project is to create a comprehensive and user-friendly website for performing common nuclear medicine calculations. Its modular architecture not only streamlines routine tasks but also paves the way for future expansion, allowing additional features and calculations to be integrated over time.
