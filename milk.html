	<h1> New born exposure through breast milk </h1> 
	<p> This tool is to only be used by a nuclear medicine medical physicist. The calculations and output from this tool require experienced understanding and interpretation.</p>
	<p> The purpose of this tool is to provide urgent calculations and advice on the dose to newborns. This will estimate worst case scenaro doses and list the <a href="#" class="pdfLink" data-pdf="milk/rps14_2 radiation protection in nuclear medicine.pdf" data-target="pdfViewer2" data-close="closeButton2"> ARPANSA RPS 14.2 (as of July 2024) </a> and calculated interruption periods.   </p>
	<iframe id="pdfViewer2" class="pdfViewer"></iframe>
	<button id="closeButton2" class="closeButton red-button">Close PDF</button>
	
	<p> This tool is designed to provide estimations of dose in an emergency or urgent case. Both the contact and milk internal dose are taken into account. New born dose can be significantly different to the listed dose depending on several patient and baby factors. <mark><b>Proceed with care when using this tool</b></mark> </p>
	
	<p> The new born effective dose coefficients are taken from: <a href="#" class="pdfLink" data-pdf="milk/Excretion of radionuclides in human breast milk after nuclear medicine examinations.pdf" data-target="pdfViewer1" data-close="closeButton1"> Leide-Svegborn, S., Ahlgren, L., Johansson, L., & Mattsson, S. (2016). Excretion of radionuclides in human breast milk after nuclear medicine examinations. Biokinetic and dosimetric data and recommendations on breastfeeding interruption.

			<li> The baby feeds every 133 mL every 4 hours. </li>
			<li> The baby feeds for 30 minutes. </li>
			<li> External exposure is calculated via the gamma constants of the isotope with patient attenuation factors included. </li>
